Wanted to migrate a simple Google Maps example over to AngularJS.

The first commit shows a working HTML & Javascript example from a Google Maps tutorial, where it just locates the user on a map.

The second commit is an attempt to migrate the first project over to using AngularJS.  All required files have been added, as well as Twitter bootstrap.  At the moment, the $scope.init() function is being called in MainController.js but nothing's being displayed.
